Smartphone Data Analysis (Explorarity &amp; Visualization)

**About Dataset**
This is the Smartphones dataset which consists of 210 rows and 26 different columns.
I did data-cleaned, data-visualizations, data-explorations(EDA), and some calculations.
This dataset is taken from Kaggle.com (open source) (and I will share the dataset link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/informrohit1/smartphones-dataset/data)
